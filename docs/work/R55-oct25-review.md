# R55: Octavia's review of Oct 25 (Dashboard K8, C1, C2, C5, D2, D4, D5; Client Sign-ups D)

Source: `docs/specs/review-2026-10-25/CHANGE-LIST.md` (sections A, C, D, F), `dashboard--developer-feedback.md`, `client-signups--developer-instructions.md`, `screenshots/client-signups-expanded-sidebar.png`.

## Schema requests for Rasel's tap (R0 drafts the migration; R55 does not touch `packages/db`)

### Request 1: Dashboard D4 (Settings service-card templates)

One new table, firm-scoped (RLS on `business_id`, like every firm table):

`dashboard_card_templates`
| Column | Type | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid (uuid7) | primary key |
| `business_id` | uuid | FK `businesses`, RLS |
| `slot` | smallint | 1 to 6; unique with `business_id` |
| `service_id` | uuid null | FK `(business_id, id)` on `services`, restrict |
| `metric` | enum `DashboardCardMetric` (`ACTIVE_ENGAGEMENTS`, `ENGAGEMENTS_IN_STATUS`, `COMPLETED_IN_PERIOD`) | not null |
| `status_key` | text null | the engagement or tax status the metric counts; null for `ACTIVE_ENGAGEMENTS` |
| `label` | text | 1 to 40 characters, trimmed |
| `enabled` | boolean | default true |
| `version` | int | default 1, for stale-edit refusal |
| `created_by_user_id`, `updated_by_user_id` | uuid | FK membership |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | timestamptz | |

Fixed cards are not rows (Total Clients, New Leads, Outstanding Invoices). The tax outcome card defaults to Accepted Returns (D5) when no row overrides it, and a row can never put a non-tax metric under a tax label (the API checks the label against the metric).

### Request 2: Client Sign-ups (D2 to D4), one request

Today the request is the `client_accounts` row (`PENDING_APPROVAL`, `ACTIVE`, `DECLINED`). There is no approval mode, version, match flag, verification or operation record. All new tables are firm-scoped (RLS on `business_id`, FK `(business_id, client_account_id)` to `client_accounts`, restrict).

1. **Approval mode with version**, on `business_settings`:
   - `client_signup_mode` enum `ClientSignupMode` (`MANUAL`, `AUTOMATIC`), not null, default `MANUAL`;
   - `client_signup_policy_version` int, not null, default 1 (raised by each change; a PATCH sends the version it read);
   - `client_signup_policy_changed_at` timestamptz null, `client_signup_policy_changed_by_user_id` uuid null (FK membership).
2. **Request version and potential-match flag**, on `client_accounts`:
   - `version` int, not null, default 1 (each decision or resolution raises it; stale writes are 409);
   - `match_status` enum `SignupMatchStatus` (`UNCHECKED`, `NO_MATCH`, `POTENTIAL_MATCH`, `NOT_A_MATCH`, `LINKED`, `RESTORED`), not null, default `UNCHECKED`, separate from `status`;
   - `match_checked_at` timestamptz null;
   - `decision_policy_version` int null (the policy version an approval or decline used), `decided_automatically` boolean, not null, default false.
3. **Match review**: `client_signup_match_candidates`
   - `id`, `business_id`, `client_account_id`, `candidate_client_id` (FK `clients`, restrict);
   - `matched_on` text[] (`email`, `phone`, `name_and_birth_date`, ...: field names, never values);
   - `resolution` enum `SignupCandidateResolution` (`OPEN`, `NOT_A_MATCH`, `VERIFIED`), default `OPEN`;
   - `reviewed_by_user_id` uuid null (FK membership), `reviewed_at` timestamptz null, `rationale` text null (at most 500);
   - `created_at`, `updated_at`; unique `(business_id, client_account_id, candidate_client_id)`.
4. **Verification record**: `client_signup_verifications`
   - `id`, `business_id`, `client_account_id`, `candidate_client_id`;
   - `contact_ref` enum `SignupContactRef` (`CLIENT_PHONE`, `CLIENT_EMAIL`, `CLIENT_CONTACT`): which contact **on the canonical record** was called, never the value or a sign-up contact;
   - `call_outcome` enum (`REACHED`, `NOT_REACHED`);
   - `identity_result` enum (`VERIFIED`, `NOT_VERIFIED`);
   - `permission_scope` enum (`RESTORE_ACCESS`, `LINK_RECORD`, `BOTH`) null, `permission_recorded_at` timestamptz null;
   - `actor_user_id` (FK membership), `created_at`. Append-only (no update or delete grant). No evidence, recordings or passwords.
5. **Resolution and operation records**: `client_signup_operations`
   - `id`, `business_id`, `client_account_id`;
   - `kind` enum `SignupOperationKind` (`APPROVE`, `DECLINE`, `LINK_EXISTING`, `RESTORE_ACCESS`, `NOT_A_MATCH`, `KEEP_PENDING`, `INVITE_DELIVERY`, `RECOVERY_DELIVERY`, `POLICY_CHANGE`);
   - `idempotency_key` text, `request_hash` text (a hash of the payload, to refuse key reuse with other data);
   - `status` enum (`COMMITTED`, `PENDING`, `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`);
   - `result` jsonb (client id, state, version: no tokens or identity evidence), `attempts` int default 0, `last_error_code` text null, `correlation_id` uuid;
   - `actor_user_id` uuid null (null for an automatic decision), `created_at`, `updated_at`;
   - unique `(business_id, idempotency_key)`; unique `(business_id, client_account_id, kind)` where `kind` in (`INVITE_DELIVERY`, `RECOVERY_DELIVERY`), so a delivery is never dispatched twice.

Audit stays in `audit_logs` (every action, old and new state, correlation id). Grants: the app role may insert and select every new table, update `client_signup_match_candidates` and `client_signup_operations`, and never delete.

## What is built without schema (this round)

- Dashboard: see "Dashboard" below.
- Sign-ups screen (D1): list, tenant-wide counts per tab, search, Date submitted sort (newest first by default), filters, Back with restored context, states and accessibility. The Checks column reads the existing email-link candidate (`existingClient`) until `match_status` lands.

## Dashboard (K8, C1, C2, C5, D2, D5)

- Periods are the firm's (business settings time zone). Month, quarter and year mean to date; Last Month and Last Year mean the full period; Custom is validated (start on or before end, end not after today).
- Comparisons use the equivalent elapsed period before: yesterday, last week to the same weekday, last month to the same day, the quarter before to the same elapsed day, last year to the same day. Last Month and Last Year compare with the full period before, and Custom with the same number of days just before.
- D5 depends on K5 (R60: Accepted Returns) and on Request 1 (D4).
